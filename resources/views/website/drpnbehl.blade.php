                     <b>Prof. Pran Nath Behl</b> was born on September 23, 1923, and received his initial education in Amritsar. He then enrolled at KE Medical College in Lahore, the only medical institution in the province at that time. In May 1946, he graduated with an MBBS degree. Then he began working as a house physician at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Lahore.
                  </p>
                  <p>However, the partition of the country compelled him to migrate first to Delhi and then to Bombay. Fortunately, his optimism and determination paid off, and he had the opportunity to study and work in England to support his education.

                  <p><b>
                     He trained for postgraduation at St. John’s Hospital for Diseases of the Skin, London from 1947-51. He successfully passed the Membership exam after four years of hard work, at the Royal College of Physicians in Edinburgh in September 1951, obtaining his MRCP in 1951 from Edinburgh, specializing in dermatology and FRCP from Scotland in 1963. He practised as a family doctor under the National Health Services from 1948-51.</b></p>
                  <p>
                     During this time, he faced numerous challenges, including the struggle for independence, societal divisions, and financial difficulties. Nonetheless, the dedication of his teachers and the disciplined approach of his fellow students helped him become a capable and responsible doctor. He had occupied a distinguished position among the leading physicians in India.</p>   
                  <p>
                     However, he is remembered as the first dermatologist in India to establish a private institute for skin, “The Skin Institute and School of Dermatology” now known as with the name of  Dr. Behl’s, SISD (Skin Institute and School of Dermatology) Greater Kailash, New Delhi.

                  <p><b>The Association of Cutaneous Surgeons (India) (ACSI)</b> has instituted an oration in the name of Dr. Pran Nath Behl, the father of dermatologic surgery in India. Dr. PN Behl is widely credited as the original describer of vitiligo surgery. He described Thin Thiersch Grafts for stable vitiligo as early as 1963- which was a landmark in the history of vitiligo surgery and performed thousands of such surgeries. He described the criteria for stability of vitiligo based on clinical and histological criteria. At a time when dermatosurgery was almost non-existent in India, he was a pioneer not only in vitiligo surgery but also in several other fields, such as dermabrasion and the treatment of keloids. </p>
                  <p>Shortly thereafter, he married a Welsh woman, Marjorie Marie Hopkins, with the consent of both sets of parents.</p>
                  <p>His pioneering work in skin surgery attracted numerous patients from both India and abroad, ensuring that the indoor wards were often full. The large outpatient department provided extensive exposure to postgraduate doctors through their regular lectures, assisting them in skin surgeries, and managing challenging cases, along with the use of advanced diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. This facility offered missionary service, free treatment for the poor, free medications, independent histopathology, and an advanced scientific research department, all under one roof, along with a 30-bed indoor ward. </p>
                  <p><b><i>Patients suffering from major chronic disorders used to be referred to Dr. P.N. 
                     Behl unhesitatingly by many dermatologists.
                     </i></b></p>
                  <p>He stressed the importance of applying time and effort to ensure no patient remained undiagnosed.</p>
                  <p><b>He has given an essential three-step formula which was inclusive of morphological diagnosis, clinical diagnosis and etiological diagnosis to manage skin disorders.</b></p>
                  <p>He believed that no disease is truly idiopathic; rather, it requires more effort to uncover the cause. He truly believed that to give long-lasting relief to the patient it is important to eliminate the cause, then treat the diseases with as minimal medication as possible and also guide them to prevent the disease in future. He always discouraged the irrational use of medications and unnecessary investigations. His approach to life was holistic.
                  </p>
                  <p><b><u>He cultivated his approach further in his two ventures, named </u></b></p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     <li>Rural-Cum-Industrial Skin and Health Institute, Dasna in Ghaziabad, and</li>
                     <li>Dr. Behl Holistic Health Institute, Ashok Vihar in Delhi.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><u><b>He was the Founder of:-</b></u></p>

                  </ul>

                  <p>As an eminent dermatologist, he travelled extensively, delivering lectures on Dermatology and Dermatosurgery in the United States, USSR, Europe, China, Africa, Japan, and the Far East. <br>
                     As he sailed back to Bombay, he realized that establishing a relatively new speciality independently was quite challenging. <br>
                     He secured an honorary appointment as a Dermatology Professor at <b>Irwin Hospital</b> in <b>New Delhi</b> through his hard work, grit, confidence and persuasive abilities. <br>
                     He was a One-Man department with a single room in the outpatient block on the first floor. Through his hard work, he raised awareness that skin afflictions can be treated specifically and prevented through certain measures. He turned his speciality into a highly sought entity. In due course, he created an independent, large outpatient service and indoor wards for the admission of skin patients, along with several postgraduate doctors and paramedics</p>
               <p> <b>
                  He introduced Skin grafting in stable vitiligo for the first time in the world in the year of 1964. He and his team under his guidance used to perform many routine surgeries for Debridement and grafting of chronic non-healing ulcers, Dermabrasion of lichen amyloidosis, leprosy deformity, and smallpox and acne scars, Excision of Keloids followed by Grenz ray irradiation.   
               
               </b></p>
               <p><u>For post-graduate education and family practitioners, he initiated two full-time courses:</u></p>
               <ul>
                  <li>M. Derma (2 years) and </li>
                  <li>Fellow of Skin Institute (FSI) (1 year) at Skin Institute & School of Dermatology (SISD). </li>
               </ul>
               <p>The National Board of Examination recognised four seats for the prestigious DNB course at his institution. <br> 
                  Every year he used to conduct the 4-day annual/biannual workshop, where he used to impart cosmetic, therapeutic and surgical skills to raise skin specialists. <br>
                  Other than that, there were about over 150 (one hundred and fifty) students who had successfully completed DNB of 2 years and 3 years and also M. Derma of full-time course of two years in Dermatology who had served not just in India but abroad as well.
                  </p>

                  <p>Over his illustrious career, he was <b><i>a prolific writer, he authored many books on dermatology which have trained MBBS students, postgraduates, and dermatologists for over five decades and over 300 articles of national and international repute, addressing significant medical, scientific, and social issues.

                        Being a philanthropist at heart, he opened a free dermatologic clinic in the Santhal Tribal Belt of Bihar to provide treatment to remote villagers. Additionally, he organized over 30 free dermatology treatment camps in remote areas of Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, and Bihar, where skin diseases were widespread. He used to travel all over the world as an invited speaker to mesmerize the delegates at international conferences with his extremely well-versed knowledge of the subject. His advice on the elimination of the root cause of skin disease and its therapy was always scientific and thought-provoking. - (photo with camp)</p>
                     

                     <p>The publishers, M/s Minerva Press in the U.K., described his experience as follows: “Kidnapped and held for fifteen days in a chilly sugarcane field in 1994, Dr. Behl, an eminent dermatologist, followed in the great tradition of John Bunyan and other captives who pit their minds against their circumstances—and win.” <br>
                        He always had dreamt of an independent autonomous charitable institution of Dermatology, which took no time to become a reality in the form of an establishment in Greater Kailash-1 with the name of Skin Institute and School of Dermatology. <br>
                        Dr P.N. Behl has also founded the Behl Public School in Dasna, Ghaziabad. It had started initially with traditional methods of education but now has since evolved significantly under the leadership of Mrs Priya Behl, CEO at Dr Behl Skin Hospital, SISD. The school has upgraded its infrastructure, to enhance the learning experience for its students. This progression reflects its commitment to providing quality education and preparing students for the challenges of the modern world. Behl Public School now accommodates over more than 400 students. It has embraced modern advancements such as computerization and the establishment of specialized labs to enhance the educational experience. Mrs Priya Behl continues to guide the school towards achieving academic excellence and fostering the overall holistic development of its students, following the vision, mission and footprints of Dr P. N. Behl, the leadership has now been taken forward by her. <br>
                        
                        He used to quote Dr. Albert Schweitzer (1875-1949) the Noble Laureate – 
                        <i><b>“Anyone who prepares to do good must not expect people to roll stones out of his way, but must accept him lot calmly if they even roll a few more upon it,” </b></i>
                     
                        whenever he was confronted for not working so hard in the world of selfish people. He always taught us to promulgate the undisbursed knowledge and keep the flag flying on this temple of service.  <br>
                        However, his unparalleled dedication, commitment, and tireless efforts towards his profession and society have cemented his legacy as a living legend, making him a true servant to humanity. Such was the noble and self-sacrificing nature of Dr. Behl; individuals like him are rare in their service to suffering humanity. 

                        <i><b>On October 15, 2002, on the auspicious day of Dussehra, Dr P N Behl left peacefully for his heavenly abode at the age of 79.</b></i>

                     <p>He always used to say <b>“To Serve Mankind Is to Serve God.”</b>  <br> 
                        <b>Life is Duty</b> was the motto of Dr. Behl. He believed one should live and perform honestly, skillfully and sincerely to build up the individuals, community and the nation.
